# Dog_vs_cat-CNN
The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or cat. Although the problem sounds simple, it was only effectively addressed in the last few years using deep learning convolutional neural networks.

### For Making This type of CNN you need to understand about Few Technical Term like...
<ul>
<li>Convolution</li>
<li>Pooling (Max/Avg/Sum pooling)</li>
<li>Flattening</li>
<li>Fulling Connection</li>
<li>Softmax Activation function</li>
<li>Loss function</li>
</ul>
